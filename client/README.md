## YELP Clone - PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React, NodeJS) Stack Tutorial

This is a tutorial I followed from freeCodeCamp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J01rYl9T3BU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

Aim of exercise for me was to familiarize with best practices in integrating PostgerSQL Database to NodeJS.

## Running the project

1. Clone/Fork the project
2. Install dependencies on client/server directories
3. Run npm start on both directories
